# Monocular-Inertial-line
This system has been modified based on the monocular + IMU mode of ORB-SLAM3 by integrating line features, thereby achieving a monocular + IMU SLAM system that utilizes both point and line features. 
To track line features, we have incorporated the constraints described in the paper 'Structure-SLAM: Low-Drift Monocular SLAM in Indoor Environments' into the system."（https://github.com/yanyan-li/Structure-SLAM-PointLine）.
This code has been adapted from the open-source code available at https://github.com/Giannis-Alamanos/ORB-LINE-SLAM. The necessary environment dependencies for running the code can be installed based on the requirements specified in the provided link (OpenCV version 4.2 is utilized).
